  Holistic review prepared: 1 files in codebase

  Workflow:
    1. Read .desloppify/query.json for context, excerpts, and investigation batches
    2. For each batch: start from listed seed files, then explore likely hotspots/unreviewed neighbors; evaluate the batch's dimensions (batches are independent — parallelize)
    3. Cross-reference findings with the sibling_behavior and convention data
    4. IMPORTANT: findings must be defects only — never positive observations. High scores capture quality; findings capture problems.
    5. Write ALL findings to findings.json — do NOT fix code before importing. Import creates tracked state entries that let desloppify correlate fixes to findings.
    6. Import: desloppify review --import findings.json
    7. AFTER importing: run `desloppify show review --status open` to see the work queue, then fix each finding in code and `desloppify plan done <id>`

  AGENT PLAN:
  1. Run each investigation batch independently (parallel-friendly)
  2. Capture findings in findings.json
  3. Import and rescan
  Next command to improve subjective scores: `desloppify review --import findings.json`

  → query.json updated. Review codebase, then: desloppify review --import findings.json
